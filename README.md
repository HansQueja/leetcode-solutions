# leetcode-solutions
My personal notes for the LeetCode problems I solve.

### Language Used
I mainly use Python to easily code up my thoughts, but I would love to use C to further optimize my code.

### What's in it for me?
I want to try to document my thought process for every LeetCode problem that I solve, and also practice complexity theory. In a way, it's like simulating the Feyman's technique, where I also learn by doing the documentations and explanations.

For every problem, I'll provide what I think is the most intuitive solution (usually brute-force), and work my way up to the most efficient solution that I could think of. I'll provide the complexity details such as runtime, time, and space complexity.
